# SneakerBot
 Sneaker prices (retail and resell) scraper that provides analysis on resell potential

## Main Features

This is an script that sends alerts for sneaker drops to users on Discord and SMS. It provides information from multiple sites on the retail price, resell price, and the profitability of each shoe. As resell sites charge fees and shipping, it factors that in, too. The main sites it scrapes are Nike, Yeezy (Adidas), and Snipes (a popular third party seller). See /Nike-Alerts, /Yeezy-Alerts and /Snipes-Alerts for specific information on each site. The two main resell sites it gets data from are GOAT (Alias) and StockX, two of the most popular sites for sneakerheads.

Note: As this was written when I was in 10th grade, I didn't follow certain design practices that I would now. as such, I plan to rewrite it in the near future.
